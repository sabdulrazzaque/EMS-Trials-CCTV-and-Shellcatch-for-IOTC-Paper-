In 2012, WWF-Pakistan initiated a crew-based observer programme to collect information using a
standardized data sheet to record the quantity and species of fish caught about catches of tuna and
tuna-like species as well as of the bycatch non-target species in the tuna gillnet fisheries of Pakistan
(Razzaque et al., 2020). One of these observers was taken onboard by the pilots of the CCTV camera
on his fishing boat from January to February 2018. The same observer was on board for the trails of
the Shellcatch Technology from August to September 2019. 

The preliminary results of the fish category, species type, species composition, species length frequency for 3 individuals, status at capture, treated and status at release are calculated in the file. in addition, it includes a growth model for some species.
